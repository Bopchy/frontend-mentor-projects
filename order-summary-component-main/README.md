## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Dart Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that I could watch for `.scss` file changes using the Dart Sass `sass --watch` CLI command. I thought that I would have to use a task runner (Gulp) or the [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) library.
```json
"scripts": {
    "compile-scss": "sass styles/input.scss styles/output.css --watch"
  }
```
