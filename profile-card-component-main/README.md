## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to place elements on top of each other using Flexbox and a negative margin. Had no idea I could do that ðŸ¤¯- a combination of `relative` and `absolute` positioning has always been my default go to. That didn't work in this case though, because absolute positioning with the current HTML structure would mean that I would have to explicitly define the height of the card, as `absolute` positioned elements cannot influence the dimensions of their parents. 

```html
<section class="card">
  ...
  <div class="card-details">
    ...
  </div>
</section>
```
```css
.card {
  ...
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
.card-details {
  margin-top: -14%;
}
```
